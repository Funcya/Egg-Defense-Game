This is a university project developed as part of a group assignment. The task was to create a multiplayer game in C language, using the SDL library. The project followed agile development methodology, emphasizing collaboration, iteration, and continuous improvement.


The project is organized into three main directories:

src/: contains all C source files
include/: contains all header (.h) files
resources/: contains all game assets such as sounds and images




To run the game, use the terminal command: ./mittspel.exe


You can find a short trailer of the game with sound below. Please note that the video is compressed due to GitHubâ€™s 10MB file size limit.
