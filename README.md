This is a university project developed as part of a group assignment. The task was to create a multiplayer game in C language, using the SDL library. The project followed agile development methodology, emphasizing collaboration, iteration, and continuous improvement.


The project is organized into three main directories:

src/: contains all C source files

include/: contains all header (.h) files

resources/: contains all game assets such as sounds and images


-------------------------
The result is a tower defense game, where players defend against waves of enemies (snakes). 
The game supports both 2v2 multiplayer and single-player offline modes. 
It was inspired by the popular Bloons Tower Defense series.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To run the game, use the terminal command: ./mittspel.exe


You can find a short trailer of the game with sound below. Please note that the video is compressed due to GitHubâ€™s 10MB file size limit.
